# A data-driven investigation into bias within stop and search practices of the police forces of England and Wales
Research question: “In the United Kingdom, a police officer has powers to stop and search any individual if the officer has ‘reasonable grounds’ to suspect the individual is carrying certain items or, under some other conditions, if a senior police officer has granted approval (see here for details). Are there biases in who experiences stop and search by the police?”

I used a combination of data science techniques, particularly ggplot2, to answer this RQ. I conclude that stop and search is disproportionately experienced by males, racial minorities and youth within England and Wales.
